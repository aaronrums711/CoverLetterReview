Please accept this letter and the attached resume as an indication of my sincere interest in the open
legal assistant position at Garvey, Schubert & Barer that I found on CAVLink, the University of Virginiaâ€™s
job database. I graduated in December 2014 with a degree in History and Sociology and would like to
gain experience in the legal field before applying to law school. While reviewing your website, I was
pleased to see that your firm operates in a wide variety of spheres. The areas of your practice to which I
am particularly attracted are the Environment & Natural Resources and Land Use & Condemnation
sectors.
